# 8 - Adding Multicast DNS support

So in the previous exercise we've made our p2p chat app work. Woo!!
As you'd probably noticed its quite annoying to have to type all those
hostnames and ports all the time.

Wouldn't it be great if you could just connect to your friends by typing
their username?

Luckily we can easily add that by using the same multicast dns tricks as we
used in [exercise 4](04.html).

## Tips

Remember that your can register a multicast dns using the [register-multicast-dns](https://github.com/mafintosh/register-multicast-dns)
module and add support for looking up domains using [lookup-multicast-dns](https://github.com/mafintosh/lookup-multicast-dns)

To choose a port based on a username you can use the [hash-to-port](https://github.com/mafintosh/hash-to-port) module
For example to map a username to a multicast dns domain and port you could do

``` js
var hashToPort = require('hash-to-port')
function toAddress (username) {
  return username + '.local:' + hashToPort(username)
}
```

## Testing

Run your chat server in your terminal like so

```
node {your-nickname} {another-nickname}
```

And in another one

```
node {another-nickname} {your-nickname}
```

If you type in the first one your chat messages should show up
in the second one.
